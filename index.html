          <h3>Background</h3>

          <p>So it's time for me to give you an idea of the foundation I stand on, the pillar or rock that upholds me in my place in time and space. The background that has brought me to this very point of designing this portfolio and why I'm involed in a coding bootcamp.</p>

          <p>Funny thing is I didn't originally come from coding, far from it. I started my journey in the chaotic stream we call life working offshore in the oil field. Young and headstrong I was ready to show the world who I am and what I'm made of. I did jobs from Roustabouting to Roughnecking, but ended up leaving the job as a mechanic for several years. Being young, I love change on the big scale, so I left the oil field to work for a procurement business that actually sold to the oil field. I realize not only am I strong physically, but I have that brain up top, and what better way to showcase it then working in a business enviroment. Starting off as a data entry employ, I realized quickly that I got the skill and know how to work up the ranks quick. Throughout the years I grew in my positions from Operations Manager, handling the logistics oof things, to General Manager overseaing the warehousing and sales side of things, all the way to VP, the big'ole Vice President. From the point I was not only overseeing all operations from sales, warehousing operations, but also the accouting side of things. I also spent a big part of my time dealing with client and vendor relations.</p>

          <p>Over 7 to 8 years I worked in this field, but I realized in the later years that I never felt the deep depth of statisfaction or fulfillment. I was lacking something huge in my life...a chance to be me. To showcase my creative side. From this point I looked into the I.T. field as I heard from friends not only is it a profitable and stable career, but it is a place for individuals to let their creative side flow. With that I started looking into Android application development. Studied that for a sort couple of months, but realized it was a hard path to enter on the junior side of things. A lot of people mentioned the position of Front-end Web Development. After looking into it, I quickly realized this was for me. A year later of teaching myself the basics, I started the applying process. I did land a job for a start up e-commerce copy. I worked on revamping prebuild e-commerce website on a platform called AmeriCommerce. I did that for about 6 months, but as the company and myself weren't going no where, I decided to start looking into new venues, but living in Houston, Texas, the oil field city of the U.S., the changes of me getting in a Front-end position were slim to none. After doing some research I came across the city of Portland in Oregon and realized that's where I need to be, but at this point in my life, I realized I need more skills and foundation under my belt to be a more attractive target for companies. Teaching myself would take too long, so I looked into bootcamps and found Epicodus. I jumped on the opportunity right away as this school show amazing potential. No only is the school across the board by big and small corporations, it's ciriculim is always kept up to the industry standard. It doesn't stop there, the class room set up is awesome as well, studend learn on their own pace, working with others along the way, but the other amazing addition to the school offers is interning at the last month of the course. You leave the school not only with the tools to know how to learn to code, but you leave with actual job expeirence.</p>

          <p>So that's a basic concept of my background. It was a read, I know, but I can assure you, who ever is reading this, that I found my place among the chaos of life and I'm happy.</p>

          <h3>Interest and Hobbies</h3>
          <p>My interest lie between a thin line between mental and physical stimilus. I like anything that's outdoors and/or also active. From weight lifting, hiking and bike riding to camping, fishing and canoeing. On the other spectrum, I love the art of conversation, people watching, reading in the form of books or internet articals. I also love podcast. We as individuals are so busy, always on the move. I'm a firm believer that you should utilize every moment of your day and that includes the times your driving or walking. In those moments, you can easly learn something new with just a pair of headphones and a device playing a podcast. Getting where you need and learning at the same time. Multitasking at it's best.</p>
