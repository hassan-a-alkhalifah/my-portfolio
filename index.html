          <h3>Background</h3>

          <p>My original background was Roustabouting, Roughnecking and mechanical work offshore in the oil field working for <em><strong>Transocean</strong></em>. After several years, I started work in the procurement business, <em><strong>COBRO International, Inc. (USA)</em></strong>, as a data entry employee and worked up the ranks to an Operations Manager, handling the logistic side of things. I futhered my progress to a General Manager and oversaw the warehousing and sales departments. Finally, I end up earning the position of Vice President, overseeing all operations from sales, warehousing operations and accounting. I also spent a big part of my time dealing with client and vendor relations. Later in the years, I left the procurment business and landed a Front-end role at a start up e-commerce company, <em><strong>Internet Heads</em></strong>. There I worked on re-vamping pre-built e-commerce websites on a platform called AmeriCommerce. As well, I built new websites for clients using WordPress. After several months, I realized I wanted to hone my developer skills even more and looked into coding bootcamps. I found as bootcamp called <em><strong><span><a href="https://www.epicodus.com/" target="_blank" title="Click Me">Epicodus</a></span></em></strong> that seemed like the right fit as the school showed amazing potential to help my skills grow.</p>

          <h3>Interest and Hobbies</h3>
          <p>My interest lie between a thin line between mental and physical stimilus. I like anything that's outdoors and/or also active. From weight lifting, hiking and bike riding to camping, fishing and canoeing. On the other spectrum, I love the art of conversation, people watching, reading in the form of books or internet articals. I also love podcast. We as individuals are so busy, always on the move. I'm a firm believer that you should utilize every moment of your day and that includes the times your driving or walking. In those moments, you can easly learn something new with just a pair of headphones and a device playing a podcast. Getting where you need and learning at the same time. Multitasking at it's best.</p>
